    <h2>ðŸ“Œ Project Development Process</h2>
    <p>
        This project was developed during my internship to apply the technologies I learned.
        I started by understanding the basics of Django and implemented CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Later, I added user authentication and authorization features.
        For the frontend, I used Bootstrap to create a simple yet functional UI.
